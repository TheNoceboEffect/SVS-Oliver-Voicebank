# SVS-Oliver-Voicebank
A great realistic sounding voice synthesizer for Scratch. Only works if you download Scratch Voice Synthesizer software. Works with future Scratch Voice Synthesizer versions for more features.

This is the README file for the Scratch Voice Synthesizer adult male voice, Oliver.

What is Scratch Voice Synthesizer?

It is a little bit like Scratch's text to speech extension, except with more features.

It features a more natural sounding voice, along with music features like BPM and autotune.

Could you give some voice samples?

There is a studio provided. You can see a project playing a song and some raw speech for you.

How do I download it?

In the description, there is a studio link which provdes the download page.

Now to installing the voicebank.

Step 1: Add to Computer

After this, add it to your computer.

In the github .ZIP file, replace the original audio with the new audio.

Rename the files if you may.

Step 2: Bug Fixes

Try to edit the JSON file and use the replace function in the text editor to replace the files and soften up the bug-fixing code. It's not as hard as you think.

For 2 out of the three blocks, the text to speech block does not need to be checked.

You're done! Enjoy!
